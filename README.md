htree.c is the main hashing program

# Hashing Performance Analysis
An experiment was conducted to analyze the effects of varying thread counts on the processing times and speed-up rates while hashing files of different sizes.

**The script/program is written in C**

**Overview:**
This repository contains the code, data, and analysis for an experiment designed to study the impact of different thread counts on the processing times and speed-up achieved when hashing files of various sizes. The aim is to understand how efficiently multi-threading can be utilized to enhance hashing performance and to identify optimal thread configurations for different data volumes.


**Instructions:**
Download the repo files to your UNIX directory

Because test files that would show significant results would be more than 25MB which is over the maximum file size to upload to GitHub, you will have to provide our own files to be hashed.

These files consist of just an extremely long line of letter characters.

**Compilation:**
Use this line to compile the file:

    gcc htree.c â€“o htree -Wall -Werror -std=gnu99 -pthread


**Usage:**
Running the script will output results to a file. To get results for a specific file output to the terminal, run the program with this usage.

    ./htree filename num_threads


**Running:**
The Script will output and write results to their respective files:
- hash_values_tc0
- hash_values_tc1
- hash_values_tc2

The script provided is: 'runp2'
Run with:  ./runp2
